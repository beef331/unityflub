# unityflub
Unity hub front end for installing versions on linux, working around xdg-open issues.

Depends on `libcurl` so on Ubuntu `sudo apt install libcurl4`.

Download the release then run it in terminal and it will fetch unity hub and allow you to specify the version you want.
All of Unity's licenses still apply so learn to read.
